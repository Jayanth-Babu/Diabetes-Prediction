# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Model

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a **Machine Learning model** that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic data. The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains key medical indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and insulin levels.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
- **Total Records**: 768 patients
- **Features**: 9 medical indicators, including:
  - **Glucose Level**
  - **Blood Pressure**
  - **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
  - **Insulin Level**
  - **Age**
  - **Diabetes Pedigree Function** (Genetic Risk Indicator)
  - **Outcome**: Binary (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data Handling & Preprocessing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** – Data Visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** – Model Training & Evaluation (RandomForestClassifier)
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Experimentation & Analysis

## 🔍 Key Findings
1. **Model Achieved X% Accuracy** (Replace X% with actual accuracy) using the **RandomForestClassifier**.
2. **Glucose Level, BMI, and Age** were the top 3 influential factors in diabetes prediction.
3. **Patients with higher glucose levels (above 140 mg/dL) had a significantly higher risk of diabetes**.
4. **Visualization of Data Trends** helped in identifying correlations between features and diabetes likelihood.

## 🎯 Conclusion
- The model effectively predicts diabetes risk with a good level of accuracy.
- Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning hyperparameters or using more advanced models like **XGBoost or Neural Networks**.
- This analysis highlights the importance of early diabetes detection based on medical data.

## 🔧 Future Enhancements
- Implement **Hyperparameter Tuning** for improved accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a **Web App using Flask or Streamlit**.
- Add real-world patient data for better generalization.
